    If fact or detection contain many elements, say more than one hundred. It will take a significant amount of time,
    even with hungarian algo, to compute the min cost maximum matching.
    In our specific case, since the cost matrix is very specific, and can only have values at limited places.
    It is thus possible to cut the initial cost matrix into several non-connecting ones. For example:
    cost_matrix = [[62, 0,  0,  0, 0,  0, 0],
                   [11, 11, 82, 0, 0,  0, 0],

    The given cost matrix is composed of three separate parts:
    cost_matrix[0:4][0:5], cost_matrix[3:4][4:5] and cost_matrix[5:end][6:end].
